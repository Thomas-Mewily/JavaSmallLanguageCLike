# JavaSmallLanguageCLike
A small langage similar to C that only use double interpreted by Java.

Support only :
- Single and multiple comments
- Variables,
- Code blocks,
- Comparisons and Boolean logic,
- Unary operators, (ex: -2)
- If and If Else
- While Loop
- Malloc/Free (and null)
- Array with any dimension
- Strings and Char
- IO system: read and write in the console
- Various mathematical functions (random, trig: cos/sin..., round...)

Do not support :
function, struct, typedef, preprocessor...

The language is dynamically typed, it don't have a type system (it only use `double`, even for pointer and array accessing...)
variable existence are checked at runtime.
